She also liked to shut up! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Oh God, what have I done? Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. You're going to do his laundry? __That's right, baby.__ *I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much.* You even love anyone pretending to be him!

## Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.

We're also Santa Claus! I'll get my kit! How much did you make me? No, she'll probably make me do it.

1. Professor, make a woman out of me.
2. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!
3. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!

### I love you, buddy!

Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. How much did you make me? Now what? Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!

* Really?!
* There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!
* A true inspiration for the children.

Then we'll go with that data file! Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Daddy Bender, we're hungry.

I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Bite my shiny metal ass. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

Okay, I like a challenge. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. No! The cat shelter's on to me.

Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?

Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? I'm Santa Claus! Oh, I think we should just stay friends.

The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. It's toe-tappingly tragic! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.

No, I'm Santa Claus! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. But existing is basically all I do! Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.

Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Do a flip! I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!

Oh yeah, good luck with that. You can see how I lived before I met you. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Soothe us with sweet lies. One hundred dollars. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!

Who are those horrible orange men? Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Do a flip!

Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Moving alongâ€¦ Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.
